# RogueLite
 
The old README is gone, long live the new README.

I'm essentially just messing with PowerShell and learning about the different methods of presenting and manipulating data. The easiest way to do this was to make this game. I have a lot of ideas and play a lot of games, so I wanted to take a shot at it. I want this to be difficult, but fun. The main priority is to learn however, and this is incredibly time consuming and becoming worse as it grows. But nothing happens in a short space of time, so I guess I'll just keep track of it and keep adding to it, because why not. 

Please check the ChangeLog for actual update information, as that's also written in Markdown for easier viewing. I'm adding notes to my Obsidian file and copying that over.

Main Takeaways from this Project:

- Large Arrays
- Large amounts of data handling and updating variables etc.
- JSON manipulation and understanding the uses within PowerShell
- Creating Functions and their uses
- Optimising large scripts, whilst keeping it clean.
- Practice with Git updating and general management.
- Using PowerShell for unintended purposes, finding work arounds for things that likely aren't supposed to be used.

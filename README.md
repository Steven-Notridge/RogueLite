# RogueLite
 
Now that the initial code's been figured out thanks to a reddit post, probably best to try and start building a basic idea of how the framework should behave. I wonder if it's worth just having tons of Modules that each have an enemy inside of it or something along those lines. Or a JSON with that information in? Though, we're already struggling on the JSON front with the RecipeBook.

Player Stats;
- Health - 10
- Attack - 1
- Defence - 1
- Crit - 2% (Eventually)

Maybe need to figure out the whole function system. Stab-Attack would be useful to just call if a choice is made. 

TODO; 
- Loop until enemy is dead (Done)
- Different attacks, 'in hand' (Done)
	- Hand = 2 cards for now (Ended up being 3)
- Energy system?
- Turns (Done)
- Randomise Enemy attacks
